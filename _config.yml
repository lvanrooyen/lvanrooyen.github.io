          A remote event tracking system using LoRa technology that improved the efficiency of data collection and transmission.
        description: |
          I designed and implemented a remote event tracking system as my thesis project. It used a Raspberry Pi gateway and ESP32 node, programmed in Python and C++, with a custom dashboard built in Plotly and Dash. It involved field tests, custom PCB development, and Matlab-based coverage analysis.
